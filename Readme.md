# **Job Search App**

A cheerful, tiny web app that helps you discover remote job postings instantly. Type a keyword, hit Search (or press Enter), and the app fetches remote roles for you using the Remotive public API. It's lightweight, friendly, and perfect for showcasing a front-end mini-project.

**Features**
- **Instant search:** Queries the Remotive API for remote job listings.
- **Clean results:** Shows job title, company, location, and link to the posting.
- **Keyboard friendly:** Press `Enter` to search from the input field.

**API**
- This project uses the Remotive public API endpoint: `https://remotive.com/api/remote-jobs?search=`. The fetch call is implemented in [script.js](script.js).

**Tech Stack**
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — zero build steps required.

**Contributing & Notes**
- Feel free to fork and experiment! Ideas: add pagination, filters, or save favorites to `localStorage`.
- The app is intentionally small so it's easy to extend for learning or portfolio purposes.

Enjoy exploring remote opportunities — happy job hunting!
